## General Information
This is my first attempt at writing an economy plugin for Minecraft! <br>
It is supposed to bring the feeling of marketing and advertisement strategy to Minecraft and tries to get players together!


## Technologies Used
- CommandAPI - version 6.5.3
- SpigotAPI - version 1.18.1-R0.1-SNAPSHOT


## Features
List the ready features here:
- Awesome feature 1
- Awesome feature 2
- Awesome feature 3


## Setup for Windows
(I do not have any idea on how to do it in Linux or Mac) <br>

This plugin has no requirement besides having to be used on Minecraft version 1.18.1! <br>

To get started, you have to set up a Minecraft server. This can either be a private or a public server. <br>
You can install a server software [here](https://getbukkit.org/get/bf7ac3b5bc08ea97d22919680d240a80) if you want to set up a private server.

After you installed the server software put it in a folder where you want your server to be running. <br>
In this very same folder you have to create a `.bat` file. I always call them `start.bat` because it starts my server. <br>
In there you have to write the following: `java -Xmx2048M -jar spigot-1.18.1.jar -nogui -o true` <br>
Pay attention to the `spigot-1.18.1.jar` part in the `start.bat` file. This has to be exactly the same as the name of your server software. It should fit, but you can never be safe enough! <br>
Then save the file and double-click it.
